# CV Gender Detection
# THIS IS A SATIRE! DO NOT TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY!

For English one of our projects is to make a piece of art that is a satire critique of a problem in society<br>
My project will be a critqiue of how computer science / engineering is a male dominated field, and how gender doesn't correlate to someone's ability to program.

main.py will run gender detection
<br>
gender.ino will run on an Arduino and will be the "output" of the gender detection

The hardware guide is the schematics for the project
